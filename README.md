# TypeScript Array to String Argument Error

This example demonstrates a common TypeScript error: passing an array of strings to a function expecting a single string.  The `greeter` function expects a single string, but an array is passed as an argument.  The solution shows how to handle this either by modifying the function signature to accept an array, or by processing the array to extract the desired string.  This is a frequent issue for developers new to type safety in TypeScript.
